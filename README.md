"Zillion Assistant" is a LUA script for the MESEN 2.0.0 emulator

Sega's "Zillion" was released for the Sega Master System game console in 1987.  "Zillion Assistant" is intended to make the game easier for new and casual players or to assist speed-runners who want a quick way to get through the game.  You no longer need to search for passwords.  Special item containers (Level Up, Zillion Upgrade, ID Card, ect.), except for bread, are automatically highlighted with different colors.  Map co-ordinance are always displayed under the players name.  On-screen messages will notify you of hidden areas or messages.  A life bar has been added to the final boss and other objects that need to be shot repeatedly.  The exact number of ID cards in your possession is always displayed when using a computer terminal.

To install, just copy the file to your "LuaScriptData" folder in MESEN.  As a LUA script, this doesnâ€™t' modify the original game code in any way.

-Enjoy!
