Sega's "Zillion" was released for the Sega Master System game console in 1987.  "Zillion Assistant" is LUA script for the emulator MESEN to make the game easier for new and casual players or to assist speed-runners who want a quick way to get through the game.  It adds the following features:

-  You no longer need to search containers for door passwords.  The 4 password symbols for each room are highlighted in green when using any computer terminal.

-  Alternatively, you can force any door open by pressing the space bar.

-  Special item containers (Level Up, Zillion Upgrade, BlueID Cards, Red Card, Floppy Disk), except for bread and infrared scopes, are automatically highlighted with different colors.

-  The exact number of blue ID cards you have will be shown when using computer terminals.

-  Your current position, using the same Letter-Number coordinate format used by the game's original instruction manual, is always displayed under the current character's name.

-  On-screen messages will notify you of special rooms where entering "EXPLODE" or "SUICIDE" into computer terminals will display secret messages.

-  On-screen messages will notify you of destructible walls and show a HP bar, letting you see how many shots are required to reveal hidden passages or secrets.

-  A HP bar has also been added to the final boss that appears after you enter the "EXPLODE" commanding into the base's main computer.

To install, just copy the file to your "LuaScriptData" folder in MESEN.  Since it is just a LUA script, it doesn't modify the original game code in any way.

-Enjoy!
